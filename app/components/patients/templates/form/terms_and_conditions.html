If we suspect fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity, we may refer content or accounts to law enforcement authorities. mTiba will not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the Service.
You understand that you are an early adopter of the Service and that the Service as offered as per these Terms might evolve if mTiba decides so.

<h3>Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration</h3>
Most user concerns can be resolved quickly and to the user’s satisfaction by emailing user support. In the unlikely event that our user care team is unable to resolve a complaint you may have (or if mTiba has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration, mediation, or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. 
<h3>Arbitration Agreement</h3>
mTiba and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:
claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
claims that arose before this or any prior agreements (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and
claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.
References to ‘mTiba’, ‘you’, and ‘us’ include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or devices under this or prior agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. 
YOU AND MTIBA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and mTiba agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
<h3>General</h3>
The Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and mTiba and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and mTiba with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software. The Terms will be governed by the laws of the country of the resident of the Site visitor.  Any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
<h3>Patient Consent for Telemedicine Services</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
Telemedicine is the delivery of healthcare services using technology when the health care provider and patient are not in the same physical location. Electronically transmitted information may be used for diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, and/or patient education, and may include any of the following: 
Patient medical records
Medical images
Interactive audio, video, and/or data communications and/or 
Output data from medical devices, sound and video files. 
The interactive electronic systems used incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the confidentiality of patient information and patient imaging data and include measures to safeguard the data and to aid in protecting against intentional or unintentional corruption. 
Potential Benefits
The potential benefits of using telemedicine are 1) being able to obtain the expertise of a remote specialist; and 2) the convenience of accessing a specialist quickly and obtaining medical guidance about my condition. 
<h4>Potential Risks<h4>
There may be potential risks associated with the use of telemedicine. These risks include, but may not be limited to: 
Information transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g., poor resolution of images) to allow for appropriate medical decision-making or diagnosis by the Physician. 
The Physician may not be able to provide medical treatment to me using telemedicine equipment nor provide for or arrange for any emergency care that you may require. 
Delays in medical evaluation and treatment could occur due to deficiencies or failures of the equipment. 
Security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of my confidential medical information. 
<br />
<strong>
I read, understand and agree to the following: 
The laws that protect the privacy and confidentiality of medical information also apply to telemedicine. Information obtained during a telemedicine encounter, which identifies me, should not be disclosed to any third party without my consent except for the purposes of treatment, payment, and healthcare operations. 
Telemedicine may involve electronic communication of my confidential medical information to other medical providers who may be located in other areas, including out-of-state. 
I have the right to withhold or withdraw my consent to the use of telemedicine during the course of my care at any time. I understand that my withdrawal of consent will not affect any future care or treatment, nor will it subject me to the risk of loss or withdrawal of any health benefits to which I am otherwise entitled. 
I have the right to inspect all information obtained and recorded during the course of a telemedicine interaction, and may receive copies of this information for a reasonable fee. Such inspection and copying of records shall be subject to the Physician. 
My condition may not be cured or improved, and in some cases, may get worse. 
My condition may require a referral to a specialist for further evaluation and treatment. 
mTiba (i) does not recommend or endorse any Physician and (ii) does not make any representations or warranties with respect to any Physician or the quality of the services or advice they provide.
Physicians and Plastic Surgeons pay a registration and/or subscription fee to mTiba.
mTiba restricts participation to Physicians and Plastic Surgeons who hold active licenses and all certifications necessary to practice any services offered to our users; however, mTiba relies on representations of the Physicians and cannot independently verify that or represent to you that any Physician has the licenses and certifications necessary to practice any services offered to our users.
Patient Consent To The Use of Telemedicine
I have read and understand the information provided above regarding telemedicine, have discussed it with my physician and all of my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. I hereby give my informed consent for the use of telemedicine in my medical care. I hereby consent to and authorize the Physician to use telemedicine in the course of my diagnosis and treatment.</strong>
